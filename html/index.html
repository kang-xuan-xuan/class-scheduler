            One painful aspect many students encounter during their selection of courses is they have to check the time schedules of 
            each course and determine whether or not there are time conflicts between their favorite courses. It would definitely not 
            be nice if you planned to take two major courses for so long just to discover that the sections you wanted to select conflicted. 
            Thankfully, <strong>Class-Scheduler</strong> provides an algorithm just for this scenario! All you need to do is click on 
            <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a>, type in your desired course numbers, and we'll schedule a perfect time table just for you! 
            We will also notify you if your courses are not takeable (prerequisites, or absolute time conflict).
